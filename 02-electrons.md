## Motivation

In the middle of the workshop we will be working on the main activity, which is to attempt to replicate a [CMS physics analysis](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP09(2017)051.pdf) in a simplified way using modern analysis tools. The final state that we will be looking at contains electrons, muons and jets.  We are using these objects as examples to review the way in which we extract physics objects information.

The analysis requires some special variables, which we will need to identify in our Open Data NanoAOD files.

## Electromagnetic objects

We call photons and electrons **electromagnetic particles** because they leave most of their energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter (**ECAL**) so they share many common properties and functions

Many of the different hypothetical exotic particles are unstable and **can transform, or *decay*, into electrons**, photons, or both. Electrons and photons are also standard tools to measure better and understand the properties of already known particles.  For example, one way to find a Higgs Boson is by looking for signs of two photons, or four electrons in the debris of high energy collisions. Because electrons and photons are crucial in so many different scenarios, the physicists in the CMS collaboration make sure to do their best to reconstruct and identify these objects.

![](fig/brem.gif){width="50%"}

As depicted in the figure above, tracks -- from the pixel and silicon tracker systems -- as well as ECAL energy deposits are used to **identify** the passage of electrons in CMS.  Being charged, electron trajectories **curve** inside the CMS magnetic field.  Photons are similar objects but with no tracks.  Sophisticated algorithms are run in the **reconstruction** to take into account subtleties related to the identification of an electromagnetic particle.  An example is the convoluted **showering** of sub-photons and sub-electrons that can reach the ECAL due to *bremsstrahlung* and *photon conversions*.

We measure momentum and energy but also other properties of these objects that help analysts understand better their quality and origin. 

## Electron variables in NanoAOD

In the pre-exercises, you learned how to find NanoAOD datasets on the Open Data Portal. One example is the [SingleElectron dataset](https://opendata.cern.ch/record/30562). The "Dataset Semantics" section has a link to the [variable list webpage](https://opendata.cern.ch/eos/opendata/cms/dataset-semantics/NanoAOD/30562/SingleElectron_doc.html). Each "collection" of objects in the NanoAOD file is linked by a common naming scheme (ex: `Electron_*`). The individual variables are shown in a table that includes the branch name, the data type, and a brief descriptive comment.

### Electron 4-vector and track information

All CMS physics objects contain basic 4-vector information: transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, azimuthal angle, and mass or energy:

Table: electron 4-vector branches

| Object property | Type | Description |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Electron_eta | Float_t | eta |
| Electron_mass | Float_t | mass |
| Electron_phi | Float_t | phi |
| Electron_pt | Float_t | p_{T} |

Most charged physics objects are also connected to tracks from the CMS tracking detectors, and therefore the electric charge can be identified from the track curvature.
Electron charge can be computed from 3 unique algorithms, so a `tightCharge` variable exists to show when multiple of the charge determinations agree. 
Information from tracks provides other kinematic quantities that are common to multiple types of objects.
Often, the most pertinent information about an object to access from its
associated track is its **impact parameter** with respect to the primary interaction vertex.
We can access the impact parameters in the xy-plane (`dxy` or `d0`) and along
the beam axis (`dz`), as well as their respective uncertainties. There is also a 3D impact parameter significance that is
very useful for identifying leptons that emerged from a heavy flavor hadron decay.

Table: electron track-related branches

| Object property | Type | Description |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Electron_charge | Int_t | electric charge |
| Electron_dxy | Float_t | dxy (with sign) wrt first PV, in cm |
| Electron_dxyErr | Float_t | dxy uncertainty, in cm |
| Electron_dz | Float_t | dz (with sign) wrt first PV, in cm |
| Electron_dzErr | Float_t | dz uncertainty, in cm |
| Electron_sip3d | Float_t | 3D impact parameter significance wrt first PV, in cm |
| Electron_tightCharge | Int_t | Tight charge criteria (0:none, 1:isGsfScPixChargeConsistent, 2:isGsfCtfScPixChargeConsistent) |

::::::::::::: callout

## Track-based info for photons

Note: in the case of Photons, since they are neutral objects, they do not have a direct track link (though displaced track segments may appear from electrons or positrons produced by the photon as it transits the detector material). While the `charge` variable exists for all objects, it is not used in photon analyses. 

:::::::::::::

### Detector information for identification

The most signicant difference between a list of certain particles from a Monte Carlo generator and a list
of the corresponding physics objects from CMS is likely the inherent uncertainty in the reconstruction.
Selection of "a muon" or "an electron" for analysis requires algorithms designed to separate "real"
objects from "fakes". These are called **identification** algorithms.

Other algorithms are designed to measure the amount of energy deposited near the object, to determine
if it was likely produced near the primary interaction (typically little nearby energy), or from the
decay of a longer-lived particle (typically a lot of nearby energy). These are called **isolation**
algorithms. Many types of isolation algorithms exist to deal with unique physics cases!

Both types of algorithms function using **working points** that are described on a spectrum from
**"loose"** to **"tight"**. Working points that are "looser" tend to have a high efficiency for accepting
real objects, but perhaps a poor rejection rate for "fake" objects. Working points that are
"tighter" tend to have lower efficiencies for accepting real objects, but much better rejection
rates for "fake" objects. The choice of working point is highly analysis dependent! Some analyses
value efficiency over background rejection, and some analyses are the opposite.

The *standard* identification and isolation algorithm results can be accessed from the physics
object classes.

### Multivariate Electron Identification (MVA)

In the Multi-variate Analysis (MVA) approach, one forms a single discriminator variable that is computed based on multiple parameters of the electron object and provides the best separation between the signal and backgrounds by means of multivariate analysis methods and statistical learning tools. One can then cut on discriminator value or use the distribution of the values for a shape based statistical analysis.

There are two basic types of MVAs that are were trained by CMS for 2016 electrons:

* **MVA with isolation**: the MVA includes standard particle-flow isolation as one of the variables used for training. This MVA is well suited for analyses considering typical prompt electrons that are likely to be isolated from jets or other objects.
* **MVA without isolation**: no isolation variables are included for training. This MVA is better suited for analyses in which the electrons might be poorly isolated from jets or other objects.

Both MVAs were assigned working points with 80% efficiency (WP80), 90% efficiency (WP90), and a very high efficiency ("loose")

Table: electron MVA ID

| Object property | Type | Description |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Electron_mvaFall17V2Iso | Float_t | MVA Iso ID V2 score |
| Electron_mvaFall17V2Iso_WP80 | Bool_t | MVA Iso ID V2 WP80 |
| Electron_mvaFall17V2Iso_WP90 | Bool_t | MVA Iso ID V2 WP90 |
| Electron_mvaFall17V2Iso_WPL | Bool_t | MVA Iso ID V2 loose WP |
| Electron_mvaFall17V2noIso | Float_t | MVA noIso ID V2 score |
| Electron_mvaFall17V2noIso_WP80 | Bool_t | MVA noIso ID V2 WP80 |
| Electron_mvaFall17V2noIso_WP90 | Bool_t | MVA noIso ID V2 WP90 |
| Electron_mvaFall17V2noIso_WPL | Bool_t | MVA noIso ID V2 loose WP |


### Cut Based Electron ID

Electron identification can also be evaluated without MVAs, using a set of ["cut-based" identification criteria](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_10_6_X/RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/python/Identification/cutBasedElectronID_Fall17_94X_V2_cff.py):

Table: electron cut-based ID

| Object property | Type | Description |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Electron_cutBased | Int_t | cut-based ID Fall17 V2 (0:fail, 1:veto, 2:loose, 3:medium, 4:tight) |
| Electron_cutBased_HEEP | Bool_t | cut-based HEEP ID |

Four standard working points are provided
* Veto (average efficiency ~95%). Use this working point for third lepton veto or counting.
* Loose (average efficiency ~90%). Use this working point when backgrounds are rather low.
* Medium (average efficiency ~80%). This is a good starting point for generic measurements involving W or Z bosons.
* Tight (average efficiency ~70%). Use this working point for measurements where backgrounds are a serious problem.

All of the cut-based working points include particle-flow isolation requirements. The `HEEP` identifier is specifically intended to improve efficiency for high-energy electrons with more than 100-200 GeV of transverse momentum. 

### Electron isolation

**Isolation** is computed in similar ways for all physics objects: search for particles in a cone around the object of interest and sum up their energies, subtracting off the energy deposited by pileup particles. This sum divided by the object of interest's transverse momentum is called **relative isolation** and is the most common way to determine whether an object was produced "promptly" in or following the proton-proton collision (ex: electrons from a Z boson decay, or photons from a Higgs boson decay). Relative isolation values will tend to be large for particles that emerged from weak decays of hadrons within jets, or other similar "nonprompt" processes.

While many of the electron identification algorithms include isolation, the isolation values are also available:

Table: electron isolation

| Object property | Type | Description |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Electron_dr03EcalRecHitSumEt | Float_t | Non-PF Ecal isolation within a delta R cone of 0.3 with electron pt > 35 GeV |

| Electron_dr03TkSumPt | Float_t | Non-PF track isolation within a delta R cone of 0.3 with electron pt > 35 GeV |
| Electron_dr03TkSumPtHEEP | Float_t | Non-PF track isolation within a delta R cone of 0.3 with electron pt > 35 GeV used in HEEP ID |
| Electron_pfRelIso03_all | Float_t | PF relative isolation dR=0.3, total (with rho*EA PU corrections) |
| Electron_pfRelIso03_chg | Float_t | PF relative isolation dR=0.3, charged component |

### Electron cross-reference indices

Electrons can be associated with both jets and photons based on the particle-flow algorithm. Since the jet and photon collections have independent array structures, the indices of the matched jet or photon is provided in the electron collection:

Table: jet and photon index branches

| Object property | Type | Description |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Electron_jetIdx | Int_t | (index to Jet) index of the associated jet (-1 if none) |
| Electron_photonIdx | Int_t | (index to Photon) index of the associated photon (-1 if none) |


## Photons

Since photons are also primarily reconstructed as electromagnetic calorimeter showers, the vast majority of their reconstruction methods are common with electrons.
Photons also have 4-vector, identification, and isolation information available in NanoAOD
